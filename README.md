# About
This repository contains all presentation materials from public presentations that Darren has presented since April 2017.

Presentations are powered by [Reveal.JS](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js).

# How To

**View presentations**

Github does not render html files by default; instead, users will be presented with the source code when a user click on a particular HTML file. A useful tool is available via [http://htmlpreview.github.io/](http://htmlpreview.github.io/) that allows users to render HTML files directly without having to clone/download the repository locally.
